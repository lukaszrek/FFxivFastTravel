# Installation

You can use FastTravel script as standalone application OR script run through AutoHotkey.

Either of them requires [Npcap](https://npcap.com) installed. If you use ACT you already have it installed. Otherwise you can download it [here](https://npcap.com/#download)

## Standalone executable

1. Download and run [fasttravel.exe](https://github.com/lukaszrek/FFxivFastTravel/releases/latest/download/fasttravel.exe).


## AutoHotkey Script

Alternatively you can run fasttravel as a AutoHotkey script:

1. Download and instal [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com)
1. Download [fasttravel.zip](https://github.com/lukaszrek/FFxivFastTravel/releases/latest/download/fasttravel.zip).
1. Extract somewhere
1. Double click fasttravel.ahk to run it

# Usage

1. In game, on character selection screen, press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + P
1. Select data center you want to travel to
1. Wait
1. Script will take away your mouse control, as it needs it to properly navigate menus
1. If anything goes wrong, CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + O will stop script and bring you mouse control back

## Troubleshooting

1. You may need to run script as administrator.


## Known issues

1. Script does no longer reads screen to track travel progress so it should work with any 
resolution / screen UI scale / shaders / theme
1. You can press TAB during travel to alt tab and then press TAB again to come back to game. It is not very reliable 
but should work good enough if it's done during waiting periods. Use TAB to go back to game, any other way would result in losing all future inputs
1. Works only when your home data center is Crystal
