# Usage

1. In game, on character selection screen, press CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + P
1. Select data center you want to travel to 
1. Wait
1. Script will take away your mouse control, as it needs it to properly navigate menus
1. If anything goes wrong, CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + O will stop script and bring you mouse control back

Works only for Crystal Data Center.

May not work if you use different UI settings than me.
